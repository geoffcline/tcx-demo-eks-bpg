Learn best practices for operating EKS clusters.

Welcome to the EKS Best Practices Guides. The primary goal of this
project is to offer a set of best practices for day 2 operations for
Amazon EKS. We elected to publish this guidance to GitHub so we could
iterate quickly, provide timely and effective recommendations for
variety of concerns, and easily incorporate suggestions from the broader
community.

# New Content for AsciiDoc (Demo)

## What is AsciiDoc?

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language used for writing documentation, articles, books, and more. It allows authors to create plain text documents with simple and readable syntax that can be converted into various formats, such as HTML, PDF, and DocBook. AsciiDoc is particularly popular in technical writing and software development due to its support for the following elemetns:


* Code blcoks
* Tables
* Lists
* Images
* Footnotes

The language's flexibility and ease of use make it a preferred choice for creating structured and well-formatted content.


## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaborative tools for software development projects. It is built around Git, a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. GitHub offers a range of feaures, including:


* Issue tracking
* Project management
* Code review
* Continuous integration

These features help streamline the development process and enhance collaboration among team members. GitHub also hosts open-source projects, enabling developers to contribute to and benefit from a vast repository of shared code and resources.


We currently have published guides for the following topics:

* xref:networking[Networking]
* xref:cluster-upgrades[Cluster Upgrades]
* xref:cluster-autoscaling[Cluster Autoscaling]
* xref:reliability[Reliability]

We also open sourced a Python based CLI (Command Line Interface) called
https://github.com/aws-samples/hardeneks[hardeneks] to check some of the
recommendations from this guide.

In the future we will be publishing best practices guidance for
performance, cost optimization, and operational excellence.
